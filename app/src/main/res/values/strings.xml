            Each course is designated by a two to four letter word identifying course offering department followed by a three-digit number with the following criteria:
1.	The first digit will correspond to the year in which the course is normally taken by the students.
2.	The second digit will be reserved for departmental use.
3.	The last digit will usually be odd for theoretical and even for laboratory or sessional courses.
The course designation system is illustrated by two examples as shown below:



        </item>
        <item>10
            The courses included in undergraduate curricula are divided into several groups as follows:
        </item>
        <item>10.1
           In each discipline a number of courses will be identified as core courses which form the nucleus of the respective bachelor’s degree programme. A student has to complete all of the designated core courses for his discipline.
        </item>
        <item>10.2
            Some of the core courses are identified as pre-requisite courses. A pre-requisite course is one which is required to be completed before some other course(s) can be taken. Any such course on which one or more subsequent courses build up, may be offered in each of the two regular semesters.
        </item>
        <item>10.3
            Apart from the core courses, students will have to complete a number of courses which are optional in nature. In that case students will have some choice to choose the required number of courses from a specified group/number of courses.
        </item>
        <item>10.4
            Non credit course(s) may be offered to a student to improve his/her knowledge in some specific fields. The credits in these courses will not be counted towards GPA and Cumulative GPA calculation but will be reflected in the transcript as satisfactory (S)/unsatisfactory (U). Non credit course(s) may be offered under the following circumstances:
If a student’s Thesis/Project supervisor feels that the study/design is highly related to course(s) offered by any other department for its students, he can recommended to the concerned Head of the Department for participation of the student(s) in the course(s). Such registration of course(s) will not affect the normal course registration of the student.

            Consistent with its resilient policy to keep pace with new development in the field of Engineering and Technology, the university will update its course curricula at frequent intervals. Such updating aims not only to include the expanding frontiers of knowledge in the various fields but also to accommodate the changing social, industrial and professional needs of the country. This can be done through deletion and modification of some of the current courses and also through the introduction of new ones.
ACUG of each department will constitute a Departmental monitoring Committee with three senior teachers of the department as members and Head of the department as chairman. This committee will monitor and evaluate the effectiveness of the Course System within the department. In addition to other teachers of the department, the committee may also propose from time to time to the ACUG any changes and modifications needed for upgrading the Undergraduate Curricula and the Course System.

        </item>
        <item>11.2
            One adviser will be assigned for a batch of students by the Head of the Department who will advise each student on the courses to be taken by the student. The adviser will discuss with the student his academic programme and then decide the number and nature of courses for which he/she can register. However, it is the student’s responsibility to keep contact with his/her adviser who will review and eventually approve the student’s specific plan of study and check on subsequent progress. The adviser should generally be of the rank of an Assistant Professor or above from the concerned department. However, in case of shortage of teachers, lecturer may also act as adviser.
For a student of second and subsequent semesters, the number and nature of courses for which he/she can register will be decided on the basis of his/her academic performance during the previous semester. The adviser will advise the students to register for the courses during the next semester within the framework of the guidelines in respect of minimum/maximum credit hour limits. The Adviser is also authorized to permit the student to drop one or more courses based on his academic performance. Special provisions exist for academically weak students with regard to make-up courses.


        </item>
        <item>11.3
            The proposed system encourages students to come in close contact with teachers. For promotion of teacher-student contact, each student is assigned to an Advisor and the student is free to discuss with his/her advisor all academic matters, especially those related to courses taken and classes being attended by him/her. Students are also encouraged to meet other teachers any time for help on academic matters.

        <item>12.2
            A student will be allowed to register those courses subject to the capacity constrains and satisfactory completion of pre-requisite courses. If a student fails in a pre-requisite course in any semester, the concerned department monitoring committee may allow him/her to register for a course which builds on the pre-requisite course provided his/her attendance and grades in continuous assessment in the said pre-requisite course are found to be satisfactory.
Registration will be done within the first ten working days of each semester. Late registration is, however, permitted under special circumstances within next five working days on payment of late registration fee as decided by the authority. Students having outstanding dues to the University or a hall of residence shall not be permitted to register. All students have, therefore, to clear their dues prior to complete the course registration procedure.

        <item>12.3
            A student would have some limited options to add or replace courses from his/her registration list, within the first ten working days from the beginning of the semester. Dropping of a course is allowed within twenty working days from the beginning of the semester. Adjustment of initially registered courses in any semester can be done by duly completing the Course Adjustment Form. These forms will normally be available in the academic section.
Any student willing to add, replace or drop courses will have to fill up a Course Adjustment Form in consultation with his/her adviser. The original copy of the Course Adjustment Form will be submitted to the academic section, and then the requisite number of copies will be made by the academic section for distribution among the concerned adviser, Head, student and controller of examination.
Any changes in courses must be approved by the Adviser and the concerned Head of the department. The Course Adjustment Form will have to be submitted to the academic section after duly filled in and signed by the persons concerned.

            13.1  The names of the students shall be struck off and removed from the student list on the following grounds:
(i)     Non-payment of University fees and dues within the prescribed period.
(ii)    Forced to discontinue his/her studies under disciplinary rules.
(iii)   Withdrawal of names from the University on grounds acceptable to the Vice-Chancellor of the University after having cleared all dues.
(iv)   Failure to earn the required credits for graduation as outlined in the respective curriculum and/or fulfill the Cumulative GPA requirements within the maximum allowed time of 7 academic years including any period of punishment. On valid medical grounds, the period may be extended by the approval of Academic Council.
13.2   In case a student whose name has been struck off the student list under clause (i) of Article 13.1 seeks re-admission within the session in which his/her name was struck off, he/she shall be re-admitted on payment of all the arrear fees and dues. But if he/she seeks re-admission in any subsequent session, the procedure for his/her re-admission will be the same as described under Article 13.3.
13.3   Every student whose name has been struck off the student list by exercise of the clause (ii) of Article 13.1 seeking readmission after expiry of the period for which he/she was forced to discontinue his/her studies, shall submit an application to the Head of the Department in the prescribed form before the commencement of the session to which he/she seeks re-admission. The Head of the department shall forward the application to the Vice-Chancellor of the University with his remarks. In case the re-admission is allowed, the student will be required of payment of all dues to get him/herself admitted not later than one week from the date of permission given by the Vice-Chancellor. All re-admissions should preferably be completed before the session starts. The percentage of attendance of the readmitted students shall be counted from the date of re-admission.
13.4   The application of a student for readmission will only be considered if he/she applies within two academic sessions from the semester of discontinuity in his/her studies in the University. Other than debarment as punishment under ordinance of the University relating to discipline, a student of any kind failing for any other reason whatsoever to become a candidate for a semester final examination in which he/she ought to have had in the usual process of his/her progressive academic activities, shall be considered to have  discontinued his/her studies for the relevant semester together with striking the name off from current student list and two such discontinuous periods will be considered equivalent to that for one academic session. The maximum period of discontinuity under no circumstances is to exceed two academic sessions during a student’s period of studies for the degree.
13.5   No student who has withdrawn his/her name under clauses (iii) and (iv) of Article 13.1 shall be given re-admission.
13.6   In case any application for re-admission is rejected, the student may appeal to the Academic Council for re-consideration. The decision of the Academic Council shall be final.

                        Grade Point Average (GPA) is the weighted average of the grade points obtained in all the courses passed/completed by a student in a semester. ‘F’ grades will not be counted towards GPA calculation. GPA of a semester will be calculated as follows:

            where n is the total number of courses passed by the student, Ci is the number of credits allotted to a particular course i and Gi is the grade point corresponding to the grade awarded for i -th course.
            The overall or Cumulative GPA gives the cumulative performance of the student from first semester up to any other semester to which it refers and is computed by dividing the total grade points (å. CiGi) accumulated up to the date by the total credit hours (åCi ).
            Both GPA and Cumulative GPA will be rounded off to the second place of decimal for reporting.
            Suppose a student has completed five courses in a semester and obtained the following grades:
            Course	Credits	Grade	Grade points
            CE 315	3	A plus	4.0
            CE 323	3	B	3.0
            CE 351	3	A	3.75
            Math 313	4	B plus	3.25
            CE 303	2	A minus	3.5

            The courses in which a student has obtained ‘D’ or a higher grade will be counted as credits earned by him/her. Any course in which a student has obtained ‘F’ grade will not be counted towards his/her earned credit calculation. A student who obtains ‘F’ grade in any core course in any semester, he/she will have to repeat the course. If a student obtains ‘F’ in an optional course he/she may choose to repeat the course or take a substitute course, if available. No ‘F’ grade will be counted for GPA calculation but will stay permanently on the grade sheet and transcript. When a student will repeat a review course in which he/she previously obtained ‘F’ grade, he/she will not be eligible to get a grade higher than B in such a course.
A student obtaining D grade in a course, will be allowed to repeat the course for the purpose of grade improvement if cumulative GPA of the student falls below 2.20 In such case he/she will be awarded the new grade that he/she obtains or retains his/her previous grade if he/she fails. A student obtaining ‘C’ or a better grade in a course will not be allowed to repeat the course for the purpose of grade improvement if cumulative GPA of the student falls below 2.20.

            The minimum cumulative GPA requirements for obtaining a B.Sc. Engineering degree is 2.20. The performance of a student will be evaluated in terms of two indices, viz. semester grade point average (GPA), and cumulative grade point average (cumulative GPA).
Students will be considered to be making normal progress toward a degree if their Cumulative GPA for all courses attended is 2.20 or higher. Students who regularly maintain semester GPA of 2.20 or higher are making good progress toward their degrees and are in good standing with the University. Students who fail to maintain this minimum rate of progress will not be in good standing rather considered to be academically weak. This can happen when one or more of the following conditions exist:
(i)      Semester GPA falls below 2.20 or
(ii)      Cumulative GPA falls below 2.20 or
(iii)     Earned credits fall below 15 times the number of semesters attended/studied
All such students can make up deficiencies in GPA and credit requirements by completing ‘F’ graded course(s) and repeating ‘D’ graded course(s) in the next semester(s). When GPA and credit requirements are fulfilled, the student is considered to be returned to good standing.

                    For a number of reasons it is necessary to have a definite system by which students can be classified as First, Second, Third and Fourth Year. The students are classified according to the number of credit hours earned towards a degree. The following classification applies to the students.
         Year                         Earned Credits
        First Year            From 0 to less than (T1 – 8)
        Second Year      From (T1 – 8) to less than  (T2 – 12)

        Fourth Year         =>(T3 – 16)
        Where
        T1 = total credits prescribed in the 1st Year 2nd Semester
        T2 = total credits prescribed upto 2nd Year 2nd Semester

            Students who regularly maintain semester GPA of 2.20 or above satisfying the minimum credit requirements are making good progress toward their degrees and are in good standing with the University. Students who fail to maintain this minimum rate of progress may be placed on academic probation.
The status of academic probation is a reminder/warning to the student that satisfactory progress towards graduation is not being made. A student may be placed on academic probation when either of the following conditions exist:
(i)    The semester GPA falls below 2.20, or
(ii)   The cumulative GPA falls below 2.20
(iii)  Earned Credits fall below 15 times the number of Semester attended/studied.
Students on probation are subject to such restrictions with respect to courses and extracurricular activities as may be imposed by the respective Head of the department. The minimum period of probation is one semester, but the usual period is for one academic year. This allows the academically weak student an opportunity to improve the GPA through the completing ‘F’ graded course(s) and repeating ‘D’ graded course(s) during the period. The probation may be extended for additional semesters until the student achieves an overall GPA of 2.20 or above. Once that condition is improved, the student is considered to be returned to good standing.
Academic probation is not to be taken lightly rather to be considered very seriously. A student on academic probation who fails to maintain a GPA of at least 2.20 during two consecutive academic years may be suspended from the University. A student who has been suspended may apply for consideration to the Dean of the faculty, but this application will not be considered until the student remains suspended at least for one full semester.
Petitions for reinstatement must set forth clearly the reasons for the previous unsatisfactory academic record and it must delineate the new conditions that have been created to prevent the recurrence of such work. Each such petition is to be considered individually on its own merits.
After consideration of the petition in consultation with the student, adviser and the respective Head of the department, Dean in some cases, may reinstate the student if this is the first suspension. However, a second suspension will be regarded as final and absolute.

Even all other technology, which is thought as munificent to human life, is also electricity or electronically controlled. The professional activities of electrical engineers directly affect the everyday lives of most of the world’s population. They are responsible for the design and development of radio and television transmitters and receivers, telephone networks and switching systems, computer systems, and electric power generation and distribution. Within the broad scope of these systems, the electrical engineer is concerned with a challenging and diverse array of design and development problems. The students who earn a B. Sc. Engineering degree from the department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering will be involved in a variety of electrical and electronic problems in the course of their careers.
    Scope of Electrical and Electronic Engineering
    The Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering plays a major role in the development of science and technology. This role is more important as the use of electronic devices and electric power is increasing in many technologies, such as VLSI, lasers, material processing, optoelectronic devices, robotics, communication, computer technology, micro-machine, electric power supply, various types of control systems etc. Since the areas covered by Electrical and Electronic Engineering are increasing, the Department provides a broad curriculum to its students to adequately address those issues. Hence The students can choose their educational program according to their interests. They can choose a program that is partly related to electronic devices, electronic applications, and/or computer and communication. Besides the theoretical knowledge, intensive care is also given so that an engineer becomes pragmatic in terms of his/her respective area of specialization. In addition, the Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering of DUET, Gazipur offers postgraduate studies and research for higher degree leading to M. Sc. Engg., M. Engg. and Ph. D. To reciprocate such venture, the department offers financial assistance to the brilliant students. The Department is also incarnated with other activities, such as, expert level training on the appropriate field for the faculty members to develop human resources, consulting different organizations to facilitate them and exchanging knowledge with different national and international universities, etc.
